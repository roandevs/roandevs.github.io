            <h4>Powerflix (archived) - A streaming platform built with NextJS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a full-stack web application with NextJS which rendered a
                    clean, easy to navigate UI that would present available movies & TV
                    shows.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented a distributed storage system with a strict
                    firewall system, a HTTP server for handling incoming requests and a
                    custom-made algorithm to scan and detect available movies & TV
                    shows on the local filesystem.</li>
                <li>Developed a real-time administrative API using WebSocketâ€™s to
                    download and keep track of movies & TV shows on the distributed
                    systems as well as implementing a custom queuing system to balance
                    the server resources when downloading and processing movies & TV
                    shows.</li>
                <li>Utilized cloud technologies such as Linodeâ€™s virtualized servers for
                    hosting download servers and Amazonâ€™s S3 buckets for storage.</li>

            <ul>

                <li>Developed a full-stack web application with NextJS which rendered a
                    simple UI to present available To-do tasks, reminders and the most
                    recent logs collected.</li>
                <li>Designed a relational database structure and implemented it with
                    PostgreSQL to store Todoâ€™s, reminder, logs and user-based data.</li>
                <li>Designed and implemented a reminder system using NodeJS, which
                    would concurrently check every so often for reminders that are due
                    based on dates. Utilized AWS services such as SES to automate
                    emailing reminders when they are due in the reminder system.</li>
                <li>Utilized in-built cryptography modules in NodeJS to encrypt, decrypt
                    and securely store all Todoâ€™s, reminder and log data. Modified Linux
                    internals to collect logs when certain protocols such as SSH or FTP
                    are used.</li>
                <li>Setup a WebSocket server to send and receive logs from Linux
                    internals and update them in real-time on the web application.</li>

                    registration and login system which utilized the databases.</li>
                <li>Reverse engineered the IMAP protocol and implemented my own
                    IMAP server using WebSocket's to send real-time emails to the mail
                    client. Created and implemented an innovative feature that allows
                    you to generate and use as many email addresses as you want as a
                    registered user.</li>
